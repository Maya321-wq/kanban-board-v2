“While IndexedDB offers better performance for large datasets, we use localStorage for simplicity during rapid development. Given that the assignment requires support for 500+ cards, we acknowledge this is a trade-off: localStorage may slow down with very large states. However, our sync queue and optimistic updates remain fully functional. In a production system, we would migrate to IndexedDB using the idb library.”
